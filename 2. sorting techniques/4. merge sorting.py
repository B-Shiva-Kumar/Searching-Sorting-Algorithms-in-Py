### Merge sort algorithm :

# Merge Sort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms that is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer Algorithm.

# worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.

# Here, a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. 
# Each sub-problem is solved individually. Finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.

### Steps :

        # 1. if two unsorted arrays are given to merge sort, it performs sorting.
        # 2. if one arr unsorted array is given, it divides into recursively until it can no more divided.
        # 3. merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.


## Pseudo Code :

# # procedure mergesort( var a as array )
# #    if ( n == 1 ) return a

# #    var l1 as array = a[0] ... a[n/2]
# #    var l2 as array = a[n/2+1] ... a[n]

# #    l1 = mergesort( l1 )
# #    l2 = mergesort( l2 )

# #    return merge( l1, l2 )
# # end procedure

# # procedure merge( var a as array, var b as array )

# #    var c as array
# #    while ( a and b have elements )
# #       if ( a[0] > b[0] )
# #          add b[0] to the end of c
# #          remove b[0] from b
# #       else
# #          add a[0] to the end of c
# #          remove a[0] from a
# #       end if
# #    end while
   
# #    while ( a has elements )
# #       add a[0] to the end of c
# #       remove a[0] from a
#    end while
   
#    while ( b has elements )
#       add b[0] to the end of c
#       remove b[0] from b
#    end while
   
#    return c
	
# end procedure
