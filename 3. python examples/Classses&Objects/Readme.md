## Classes & Objects in Python Overview :

1. **Classes and Objects**:
    - In Python, everything is an **object**, which means it has **properties** (attributes) and **methods** (functions).
    - A **class** serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of the objects.
    - To create a class, use the `class` keyword. For example:
        ```python
        class MyClass:
            x = 5
        ```
        Here, `MyClass` has a property `x` with a value of 5.

2. **Creating Objects**:
    - Once you have a class, you can create **objects** based on that class.
    - To create an object, simply use the class name followed by parentheses. For example:
        ```python
        p1 = MyClass()
        ```
        Now `p1` is an object of the `MyClass` class.

3. **The `__init__()` Function**:
    - The `__init__()` function is a special method that gets called automatically when an object is created from a class.
    - It initializes object properties. For example:
        ```python
        class Person:
            def __init__(self, name, age):
                self.name = name
                self.age = age

        p1 = Person("John", 36)
        print(p1.name)  # Output: John
        print(p1.age)   # Output: 36
        ```

4. **The `__str__()` Function**:
    - The `__str__()` function controls what should be returned when the object is represented as a string.
    - If not set, the default string representation of the object is returned.
    - Example with `__str__()`:
        ```python
        class Person:
            def __init__(self, name, age):
                self.name = name
                self.age = age

            def __str__(self):
                return f"{self.name} ({self.age})"

        p1 = Person("John", 36)
        print(p1)  # Output: John (36)
        ```

4. **`self`**:
    - self is used to refer to the instance of the class. The __init__ method initializes the attributes of the object.
    - Example:
        ```
        class Car:
            def __init__(self, make, model, year):
                self.make = make
                self.model = model
                self.year = year

            def get_make(self):
                return self.make

            def get_model(self):
                return self.model

            def get_year(self):
                return self.year
        ```
        
        - `get_make`, `get_model`, and `get_year` are instance methods that return the make, model, and year of the car object, respectively.
        - When we create an instance of the Car class, we pass in the make, model, and year as arguments, and these values are stored as attributes of the object.
        - We can then use the `get_make`, `get_model`, and `get_year` methods to retrieve the values of these attributes.

        ```
        # access Car methods:

        my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022)
        print("Make:", my_car.get_make())
        print("Model:", my_car.get_model())
        print("Year:", my_car.get_year())
        ```

5. **Object Methods**:
    - Objects can also contain methods (functions).
    - Methods belong to the object and can be called on it.
    - Example with a method:
        ```python
        class Person:
            def __init__(self, name, age):
                self.name = name
                self.age = age

            def myfunc(self):
                print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}")

        p1 = Person("John", 36)
        p1.myfunc()  # Output: Hello, my name is John
        ```

Remember, classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. They allow you to organize and model your code effectively! ðŸ˜Š
